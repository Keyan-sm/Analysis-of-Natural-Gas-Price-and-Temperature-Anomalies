I collected historical Henry Hub Natural Gas (HHNG) spot prices and US regional average temperature data from federal online sources. I extracted the residual data from the Henry Hub Natural Gas spot price graph by removing long-term trends and seasonal patterns. I identified seasons within the top and bottom percentiles of average temperatures for their specific season, termed 'temperature anomalies.' Comparing these anomalies to the residuals of the HHNG price graph revealed a correlation between anomalous temperature points and locally extreme residual points. This finding supports a correlation between anomalous temperatures in the US and the price of Henry Hub natural gas, corroborated by market sentiment.
